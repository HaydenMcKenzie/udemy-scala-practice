I looked through the project an noticed I was running version 2.13 of Scala
I wanted to change to 3.3.1 as that is my current version

So I downloaded the version 3.3.1 and added as a version in my config

When I went to run a basic program, it came up with a TASTy error

The actually error is:
class file scala/runtime/$throws$package.class is broken, reading aborted with class dotty.tools.tasty.UnpickleException
TASTy signature has wrong version.
 expected: {majorVersion: 28, minorVersion: 0}
 found   : {majorVersion: 28, minorVersion: 3}

This TASTy file was produced by a more recent, forwards incompatible release.
To read this TASTy file, please upgrade your tooling.
The TASTy file was produced by Scala 3.3.1-bin-nonbootstrapped.

Solution:
To fix this, when into my build.sbt file to change the scalaVersion := "3.0.2" to "3.3.1"

I did try to change project/build.properties my sbt.version from "1.5.5" to "1.6.7"
I then typed in the terminal:
    sbt clean
    sbt compile
However, wasn't pick up 1.6.7 and threw this error:
[error] [launcher] could not retrieve sbt 1.6.7

So I fiddled around and changed it back to 1.5.5 and it somehow worked
